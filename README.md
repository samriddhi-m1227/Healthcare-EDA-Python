Python EDA Project on Exploring Drowsiness Patterns in Wearable Device Data

The dataset was created using a Galaxy Watch4 smartwatch vital signs sensors. Data were collected from heart rate and PPG sensors (PPG includes 3 variations, green, red and infrared). The 'drowsiness' column refers to the label assigned by the user based on an adaptation of the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) Labels range from 0.0 to 2.0, where 0.0 represents level 1 on the KSS scale (Alert), 1.0 corresponds to level 6 (Some signs of sleepiness), and 2.0 indicates level 8 (Sleepy, but some effort to stay awake)
